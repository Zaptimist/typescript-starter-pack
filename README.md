# My TypeScript Starter Project

This is a starter template for a TypeScript project that includes configurations for TypeScript, Yarn, Node.js 18, and ESLint (optional), along with the installation of `ts-node` for running TypeScript files directly.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 installed globally on your system
- Yarn installed globally on your system

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or create a new directory for your project.

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-typescript-project.git
cd my-typescript-project`


2. Install the project dependencies.

`yarn install`


3. Install `ts-node` globally.

`yarn global add ts-node`


4. Run TypeScript files directly with `ts-node`.

`ts-node src/index.ts`


5. Start writing TypeScript code!

You can now start writing TypeScript code in the `src` directory of your project. You can use `ts-node` to run TypeScript files directly without having to compile them to JavaScript first.

Optional: If you want to use ESLint for linting your TypeScript code, you can configure ESLint according to your preferences and run it using a script in your `package.json` file. You can also configure EditorConfig for enforcing code formatting rules in your project.

That's it! You now have a basic TypeScript project set up with `ts-node` for running TypeScript files directly, along with optional configurations for ESLint and EditorConfig. You can customize this template further based on your specific project requirements. Happy coding!
